Hi, I'm Tom and I work as a senior consultant for a small Austrian software development company.

We focus on corporate process management and IT documentation based on Microsoft products in conjunction with our own ISV-solutions. There's a lot of customization options in our tools so I've got to deal with anything from HTML, CSS and JS to SVG, XSL and VBA on a day to day basis.

I was always into web design, doing my first websites more than 15 years ago when _Times New Roman_, `marquee` tags and frames were still state of the art.

This site will serve me as a journal and testing ground for anything related to what I deal with on the job and otherwise.
