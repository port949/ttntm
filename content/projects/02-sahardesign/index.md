### Tools

For this project, the following tools/frameworks/services were used:

- hugo
- Tailwind CSS
- fuse.js
- gulp
- Netlify
- forestry.io

### Summary

I had (still having) a blast working with Tailwind - once you've gotten used to it, it's incredibly fast and super flexible.

Refusing to use jQuery here, let's see for how long it'll stay that way.

<s>Aside from that, this site is still a work in progress, features/sections (blog, portfolio,...) are going to be added to it gradually over time.</s>

The blog, a portfolio section and the services page were added in summer 2019.

Notable enhancements as of Oct. 2019:

- content management via {{< link-underline-ext "forestry.io" "forestry.io" >}}
- "static search" based on a JSON index and {{< link-underline-ext "fuse.js" "fusejs.io" >}}
- "static comments" based on {{< link-underline-ext "css-tricks.com/jamstack-comments" "css-tricks.com/jamstack-comments" >}} and {{< link-underline-ext "github.com/ttntm/hugo-comments" "github.com/ttntm/hugo-comments" >}}
