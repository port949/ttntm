### Tools

For this project, the following tools/frameworks/services were used:

- hugo
- Tailwind CSS
- gulp
- Netlify

### Summary

I had (still having) a blast working with Tailwind - once you've gotten used to it, it's incredibly fast and super flexible.

Refusing to use jQuery here, let's see for how long it'll stay that way.

Aside from that, this site is still a work in progress, features/sections (blog, portfolio,...) are going to be added to it gradually over time.
