**Hi, I'm Tom.**

This site's domain name is short for _teitantom_, an alias I've been using for video games, Steam, PSN etc. for as long as I can remember.

I grew up with the internet, doing my first websites more than 15 years ago when _Times New Roman_, `marquee` tags and frames were still state of the art and my HTML was hacked into Notepad or Proton predominantly. I was lucky enough to be taught C, some JavaScript and Pascal in school for some years too - I'm sure I didn't appreciate that as much back then as I do now, but it certainly provided a solid foundation.

Currently, I work as a senior consultant for a small Austrian software development company focused on corporate process management and IT documentation based on Microsoft products that we enhance with our own ISV-solutions.

There's a lot of customization options in our products and solutions, so I've got to deal with anything from HTML, CSS and JavaScript to SVG and VBA on a day to day basis. I'm also involved in product management, release planning, systems and application architecture and requirements engineering.
